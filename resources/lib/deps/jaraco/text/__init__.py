class FoldedCase(str):
    """
    A case insensitive string class; behaves just like str
    except compares equal when the only variation is case.

    >>> s = FoldedCase('hello world')

    >>> s == 'Hello World'
    True

    >>> 'Hello World' == s
    True

    >>> s != 'Hello World'
    False

    >>> s.index('O')
    4

    >>> s.split('O')
    ['hell', ' w', 'rld']

    >>> sorted(map(FoldedCase, ['GAMMA', 'alpha', 'Beta']))
    ['alpha', 'Beta', 'GAMMA']

    Sequence membership is straightforward.

    >>> "Hello World" in [s]
    True
    >>> s in ["Hello World"]
    True

    Allows testing for set inclusion, but candidate and elements
    must both be folded.

    >>> FoldedCase("Hello World") in {s}
    True
    >>> s in {FoldedCase("Hello World")}
    True

    String inclusion works as long as the FoldedCase object
    is on the right.

    >>> "hello" in FoldedCase("Hello World")
    True

    But not if the FoldedCase object is on the left:

    >>> FoldedCase('hello') in 'Hello World'
    False

    In that case, use ``in_``:

    >>> FoldedCase('hello').in_('Hello World')
    True

    >>> FoldedCase('hello') > FoldedCase('Hello')
    False

    >>> FoldedCase('ÃŸ') == FoldedCase('ss')
    True
